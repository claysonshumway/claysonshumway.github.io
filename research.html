    I've published in the Journal of Economics and Stata journal. 
    I currently research on the effects and causes of air pollution and extreme temperatures.

    <p>
            I analyze the effect of the 2018 trade war on ambient levels of air quality in the United States of America.
             Domestic tariffs placed by the US on imported foreign goods and foreign tariffs applied to US exports by other countries both impact US production,
              which can translate into emissions. Using the EPA's Air Quality dataset, PM2.5 monitor readings, 
              and satellite PM2.5 data, I implement a shift-share methodology to demonstrate that exposure to foreign tariffs results in a modest improvement in air quality,
               with null results for exposure to domestic tariffs.
             I provide insight and empirical evidence on the existence and magnitude of pollution haven effects.

    “Workplace disruptions, judge caseloads, and judge decisions: Evidence from SSA judicial corps retirements," 
    with Riley Wilson <i>Journal of Public Economics</i>, (January 2021)

    <p>
  We exploit judge retirements from the Social Security Disability Insurance judicial corps to document how remaining judges respond to workplace disruptions. When a peer judge retires, the remaining judges see a 5 percent increase in dispositions and decisions that lasts 6 months. Institutional features of the disability appeal process allow us to estimate what happens to judge decisions when caseloads increase, holding the composition of cases fixed. Increased caseloads are accompanied by a 1 percent decrease in the judges’ share of favorable decisions, suggesting 16,600 claimants in-sample were not awarded disability insurance who would have been, absent the workplace disruption.
